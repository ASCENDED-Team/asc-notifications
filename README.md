    title: 'Some Notification...',

    duration: 5000,
});
```

# Usage with Rebar PluginAPI:

```javascript
import * as alt from 'alt-server';
import { useRebar } from '@Server/index.js';

const Rebar = useRebar();
const messenger = Rebar.messenger.useMessenger();
const NotificationAPI = await Rebar.useApi().getAsync('use-notification-api');

NotificationAPI.create(player, {
    title: 'Success',
    subTitle: 'Spawned vehicle',
    message: `Successfully spawned Fulltuned Vehicle [Model: ${model}] at your current position.`,
    icon: 'âœ…',
    duration: 15000,
});
```
